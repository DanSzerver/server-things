HOW DO I INSTALL THIS SHIT

First of all, install the latest Forge for 1.7.10. Google is your friend.
(Note: DO NOT USE RECOMMENDED, USE LATEST INSTEAD)

Then, clone this repo and get the contents in to your .minecraft folder. If you don't want to use git, downloading as a zip and extracting the contents works too.

That's it! You're not a scrub any more!

(Note: The mods and config are in the main branch. If you want a local copy of the server, check out the server branch.)
